Script needs to call Salesforce Marketing Cloud APIs in a secure manner;
Credentials or other sensitive data should not be kept within build or repository;
Script should be schedulable e.g. once per day;
Script should fetch all updated or new content blocks since last run and copy its content into selected storage i.e. local file storage or cloud-based object storage like Amazon S3 / Google Cloud Storage.
